# Music Genre Classification
Task 7 @Elevvo ML Internship

## Instructions
1. Dataset (Recommended): GTZAN ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)).
2. Classify songs into genres based on extracted audio features.
3. Preprocess features such as MFCCs or use spectrogram images.
4. Train and evaluate a multi-class model using tabular or image data.
5. If image-based, use a CNN model.

### Bonus:
1. Try both tabular and image-based approaches and compare results.
2. Use transfer learning on spectrograms.
